# Sorting Algorithms Comparision

This repository contains code to apply various sorting algorithms on a dataset provided in `data.csv`. The goal is to sort the numeric attributes of the dataset in both nonincreasing and nondecreasing order using popular sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Additionally, computational time for each algorithm will be recorded and plotted using bar graphs.

## Dataset
The dataset provided (`data.csv`) contains numerical attributes. 

## Tasks
1. Extract all numeric attributes from the dataset.
2. Handle missing values in attributes by filling them with the median value.
3. Sort the data into nonincreasing and nondecreasing order using various sorting algorithms.
4. Record the computational time (processor time) for each sorting algorithm.
5. Plot the running time using bar graphs.

## Files
- `main.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of sorting algorithms, data preprocessing, and visualization of computational time.
- `data.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset to be sorted.

## Sorting Algorithms Used
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Running the Code
To run the code:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open `main.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Results
After running the code, you will get:
- Sorted data.
- Computational time (processor time) for each sorting algorithm.
- Bar graphs showing the running time of each algorithm.
